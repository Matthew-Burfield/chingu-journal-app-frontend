The app is built in React using next.js for server-side rendering and material-ui for styling.

The backend uses an sql/prisma database hosted on Heroku with a Yoga server running graphql.

## TODO:

This app was built in a hurry to try and qualify for Voyage 16 so there are still a couple of todo items
that I'd like to do before I would call this app finished.

1. Edit/delete of journal entries.
2. A proper landing page
3. Loading states
4. Better styling and collapsing menu
